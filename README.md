Author Name: Sarah Jelimo Kimutai Description of Project: This is the landing page for my programming portfolio to showcase my work over time as I lear how to program in different programming languages. I have used HTML and CSS languages. The page also has a short description of who I am and my aspirations as an upcoming web developer. Project Setup Instructions: The Project should be in HTML and CSS. It should incorporate some of the common HTML tags, a custom-made stylesheet that uses cascading, the box model, and float. It should have accurate identation and spacing in the HTML and CSS code. The program should also make commits often which entail clear messages of why the action was carried out. The project is also supposed to be deployed to GitHub Pages and finally, the README should be informative.
